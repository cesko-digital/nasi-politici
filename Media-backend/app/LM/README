Czech MorphoDiTa Models
=======================

To use this model, you need MorphoDiTa: Morphological Dictionary and Tagger, an
open-source tool for morphological analysis of natural language texts. Please
visit the MorphoDiTa website http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita for more
information.


Czech MorphoDiTa Models
=======================

Czech models are distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence. The Czech
morphology uses the MorfFlex CZ 161115 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1834)
Czech morphological dictionary and the Czech tagger is trained on PDT 3.0
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0). The morpholodical derivator is uses the
DeriNet 1.2 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet). Czech models work in MorphoDiTa
version 1.9 or later.

Apart from MorfFlex CZ dictionary, a prefix guesser and statistical guesser are
implemented and can be optionally used when performing morphological analysis.

Czech models are versioned according to the version of the MorfFlex CZ
morphological dictionary used, the version format is YYMMDD, where YY, MM and DD
are two-digit representation of year, month and day, respectively. The latest
version is 161115.

Compared to Featurama http://sourceforge.net/projects/featurama/
(state-of-the-art Czech tagger implementation), the models are 5 times faster
and 10 times smaller.

Czech Morphological System
--------------------------

In the Czech language, MorphoDiTa uses Czech morphological system by Jan Hajič
(Hajič 2004 (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)). In this system,
which we call PDT tag set, the tags are positional with 15 positions
corresponding to part of speech, detailed part of speech, gender, number, case,
etc. (e.g. NNFS1-----A----).  Different meanings of same lemmas are
distinguished and additional comments can be provided for every lemma meaning.
The lemma itself without the comments and meaning specification is called a raw
lemma. The following examples illustrate this:

- Japonsko_;G (raw lemma: Japonsko)
- se_^(zvr._zájmeno/částice) (raw lemma: se)
- tvořit_:T (raw lemma: tvořit)

For a more detailed reference about the Czech morphology, please see Lemma and
Tag Structure in PDT 2.0
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/doc/manuals/en/m-layer/html/ch02.html).


Main Czech Model
----------------

The main Czech model contains the following files:

czech-morfflex-161115.dict
  Morphological dictionary based on the Jan Hajič's (Hajič 2004
  (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)) system with PDT tag set
  created from MorfFlex CZ 161115 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1834)
  morphological dictionary and DeriNet 1.2 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet).

czech-morfflex-pdt-161115.tagger
  Tagger trained on the training portion of PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) using the neopren feature set. It contains
  the czech-morfflex-161115.dict morphological dictionary. and reaches 95.55%
  tag accuracy, 97.86% lemma accuracy and 95.06% overall accuracy on PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (whose morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the czech-morfflex-161115.dict dictionary). Model
  speed: ~15k words/s, model size: 18MB.


Part of Speech Only Variant
---------------------------

The PDT tag set used by the main Czech model is very fine-grained. In many
situations, only the part of speech tags would be sufficient. Therefore, we
provide a variant of the model, denoted as pos_only, where only the first two
characters of the fifteen-letter tags are used, representing the part of speech
and detailed part of speech, respectively. There are 67 such two-letter tags.

czech-morfflex-161115-pos_only.dict
  Morphological dictionary based on the Jan Hajič's (Hajič 2004
  (http://books.google.cz/books?id=sB63AAAACAAJ)) system created from MorfFlex
  CZ 161115 (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1834) morphological dictionary and
  DeriNet 1.2 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet). Only first two tag characters
  of PDT tag set are used.

czech-morfflex-pdt-161115-pos_only.tagger
  Very fast tagger trained on the training portion of PDT 3.0
  (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) using the neopren feature set. It contains
  the czech-morfflex-161115-pos_only.dict morphological dictionary and reaches
  99.01% tag accuracy, 97.69% lemma accuracy and 97.66% overall accuracy on PDT
  3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the czech-morfflex-161115-pos_only.dict
  dictionary). Model speed: ~250k words/s, model size: 5MB.


No Diacritical Marks Variant
----------------------------

Sometimes the text to be analyzed does not contain diacritical marks. We
therefore provide variants of the morphological dictionary and tagger for this
purpose - morphological analysis, morphological generation and tagging employ
forms without diacritical marks. Note that the lemmas do have diacritical marks.

We provide the no_dia variants for all four models described above:

czech-morfflex-161115-no_dia.dict
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-161115.dict.

czech-morfflex-pdt-161115-no_dia.tagger
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-161115.tagger. It reaches
  94.69% tag accuracy, 97.06% lemma accuracy and 93.84% overall accuracy on PDT
  3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological tags and
  lemmas were remapped using the czech-morfflex-161115-no_dia.dict dictionary)
  with diacritical marks removed. Model speed: ~7.5k words/s, model size: 22MB.

czech-morfflex-161115-no_dia-pos_only.dict
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-161115-pos_only.dict.

czech-morfflex-pdt-161115-no_dia-pos_only.tagger
  No diacritical marks variant of czech-morfflex-161115-pos_only.tagger. It
  reaches 98.55% tag accuracy, 97.07% lemma accuracy and 97.02% overall accuracy
  on PDT 3.0 (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0) etest data (which morphological
  tags and lemmas were remapped using the
  czech-morfflex-161115-no_dia-pos_only.dict dictionary) with diacritical marks
  removed. Model speed: ~125k words/s, model size: 11MB.


Models with Raw Lemmas
----------------------

The Czech morphological system distinguish different meanings of same lemmas by
numbering the lemmas with multiple meanings and supplying additional comments
for every lemma meaning, as described and demonstrated in Czech Morphological
System. Sometimes this may be undesirable, for example when comparing to systems
which do not use the MorfFlex CZ (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1834)
morphological dictionary.

To obtain lemmas without any additional information (raw lemmas in terms of
MorphoDiTa API), use strip_lemma_id tag set converter.  Previously, specific
dictionary and tagger model variants were provided, which is not needed anymore.
